# Machine Learning Frameworks

Basic Frameworks for Machine learning based projects

Create by Bruce Bland

Allows user a quick start to building complex machine learning projects the right way.

Two frameworks exist at the moment. The first allows random forrest style regression, and the secon Neural Network style regression.
More types of model will be added in the future.

Additional scripts allow the testing of prediction function using single input data along with microbenchmarking the performance of the prediction function.

Models supported now include keras for development of more complex NN models, and a new test set of data which is more controlable.
