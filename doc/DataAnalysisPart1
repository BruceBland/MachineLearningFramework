#Data Analysis using BenchTest

#####*Created date : **`r Sys.Date()`** *
#####By: B G Bland

#Introduction

This document looks at a number of functions provided by the BenchTest package and gives working examples of how they can be used to provide basic data analysis of a set of well known data sets.

#Visualisation of data

The document will also show how better visualisation can help understand the data being analysed as well as provide others with a better explaination of the analysis being carried out.

#MTCARS Data set

Whereever possible the MTCARS data set will be used. This is pre-installed with base R and although it contains little data, the principles of data analysis do remain largely the same.

#Document sections

The document will be split into a number of different sections covering different types of data as follows:

*Data formats in R - Handling data formating

*Numeric data, and regression principles

*Missing data, outliers

*Binning data and histgrams

*Automatic binning and initial field analysis

*Success and failure plots
